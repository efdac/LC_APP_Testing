# Testing Projects

## Overview

This repository includes testing projects for two applications: **LearningCurveApplication** and **WinjGo**. The work involves comprehensive testing processes, including creating test cases, writing bug reports, processing test cases, managing application testing, and conducting regression testing at the final stage.

## Project Details

### LearningCurveApplication
- Created detailed test cases to ensure the application's functionality.
- Identified and documented bugs, then reported them effectively for team review.
- Processed test cases to verify and validate requirements, ensuring high-quality standards.
- Conducted rigorous application testing to identify areas for improvement.
- Performed regression testing at the final stage to confirm system stability after updates.

### WinjGo
- Developed test cases to cover all key functionalities of the application.
- Documented bugs in structured reports for efficient bug tracking and resolution.
- Reviewed and processed test cases to confirm accuracy and alignment with project requirements.
- Performed thorough application testing to enhance performance and usability.
- Executed regression testing at the end of testing to ensure no new issues were introduced with changes.

## Additional Information
Each project follows a structured testing process designed to improve application quality and user experience, with regression testing confirming system stability and reliability before release.
